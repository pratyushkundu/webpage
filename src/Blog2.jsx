                <h4>Please tell us where you did high school and senior school and how you took ceramic engineering in REC.</h4>
                <p>I am from Bhubaneswar and I did my schooling and college there itself. When it came to joining engineering
                    college, REC was one of the best at that time. According to my scores, and from what was left to choose
                    from, I took Mining Engineering but I was particularly not interested in continuing with it. So, I decided
                    to change my branch after the 1st year. Ceramic engineering was quite new and there was this buzz around the
                    campus regarding the branch and material science seemed interesting to me so I chose it.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>What was the change in your perception and outlook that you observed right from the day you joined REC till
                    you completed post-doctoral research? </h4>
                <p>Since I joined the department and went on to study the different sub-types of ceramics, I also had undergone
                    industrial training/internship and from then on I decided that no matter what, I am not going to work in a
                    refractory industry and spend my time in the shop floor. With that perception I pursued nano-ceramics. This
                    continued till I completed my PhD and then I got a job at Seagate. It was smooth sailing but also with a lot
                    of hard work. Even after the job, I was not having a mindset to work in a typical industry so I went on for
                    post-doctoral research. But finally, I joined Vesuvius, doing the thing I had decided in the beginning that
                    I won't. At each phase of my life, I've wanted to and tried to do something different. This general
                    perception hasn't changed even now as I am doing MBA along with my job.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>What are the major differences between doing MBA in India and abroad including the knowledge gained and
                    overall exposure?
                </h4>
                <p>I am pursuing MBA in Kelley School of Business, Indiana University through a full-time course but I haven't
                    yet completed the course. I cannot totally compare the MBA in India and abroad but in a broader sense, MBA
                    courses in developing courses like India are more Services based and here they are more inclined towards
                    management.
                </p>

                {/* </p> */}
                <h4>What was the toughest challenge you had faced during your journey from REC to versuvius USA?</h4>
                <p>Probably the toughest thing that I had to face was the recession of 2009. I was working as a Manufacturing
                    Engineer till then at Seagate Technologies. The global financial crisis led to the most severe economic
                    recession ever after 1930s. I lost my job and I was struggling for the visa and related stuff. That period
                    of few months was the toughest for me. Eventually I made up my mind to research further about nanocomposites
                    and nanoindentations and I started the post-doctoral research at North Dakota State University.</p>
                <br />
                <h4>Did you tailor make yourself to pursue a particularly attractive goal or did you choose your goal according
                    to your interests? </h4>
                <p>From the very beginning, it has always happened with me that I ended up doing something that I didn't want to
                    do initially. It doesn't mean that I don't like what I do. I give my 100% in everything, be it academics,
                    research, social life or my job. I didn't pursue a very specific goal but overall, my career was built
                    around my interests which I gained over the time, which is, even if not so diversified, isn't just
                    concentrated to my research areas. The drive to undertake different things and doing complete justice to it
                    shaped my future and brought me to where I am.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>How was your experience while pursuing PhD and post-doc?</h4>
                <p>Pursuing PhD after B.Tech. wasn't planned. I was looking for Master's programs and I got in correspondence
                    with several universities. I got response from North Dakota State University but it was specified that they
                    do not offer Master's degree so I changed my application and applied for PhD. The whole experience of 5
                    years was very good actually and I used to take classes there too, although I was not into academia much.
                    After PhD and the job at Seagate, during post-doc, we collaborated with various research institutes and even
                    some of the R&D units of industries like Johnson & Johnson. 
                </p>

                <h4>What advice would you want to give us, the students to boost our confidence in ceramics?
                </h4>
                <p>Ceramics, as a branch of engineering is a very good place to be in. It is so versatile, you can jump to any
                    sister branch say mechanical engineering, metallurgical engineering (application) and various other fields
                    like nano materials, energy solutions too. As an emerging field of study there is a lot to explore and it is
                    quite interesting too. Just keep an open mind and follow your interests with determination.</p>
